          <p style="height:170px;overflow-y:scroll;">Okay guys, so we're ready little technical difficulty here.
So for that reason, we have to have the the middle screen, you know to live on the on the laptop for the duration of the class and the two side screens on the pad.
But you remember I mentioned last time that for the next couple problems that we want to solve using the greedy method.
We're going to need some more advanced data structures and that got us into the discussion of priority choose one way to implement a priority queue we talked about last time was binary heap right now a priority to can be implemented using as well.
But I want you guys to be aware of the other types of heap that are out there that can help you implement a priority to  And then we're going to jump back into greeting.
So so the binomial tree B20 consist of only one node a binomial tree bisa pakai consists of two binomials trees piece of K - 1 that are linked together.
So sad the root of 1 is the leftmost child of the roots of the other show me Sub-Zero is going to be just one piece of one is going to be to be Sub-Zero's one is the left most child of the other piece of shoe you see it's to be someone this is a piece of one.
So this is a contract with a fine binary ink being constructed using only a single binary tree.
You guys remember the men he property there the key value for their nose.
The other property is that for any non-negative integer K. There's at most one binomial tree in h whose Roots has degree K. So you can't you can't have for example two piece of to sort Ruby Civ 5 in a single binomial Heat.
So you can actually think of the the binary bind up the binomial trees that you do you end up with in a binary binomial live in terms of the the the bits representing the size of of the heap in binary.
How many how many binomial trees are you going to have in a binomial heap a size 8?
this one and that would be  ABI Saab  a piece of three remember  piece of three has eight nodes exactly eight nodes in it.
No, because the minimum elements could be over here or here or hear it could be at one of the roots of the binomial tree.
So for example,  Inapposite that left right most position you have a one so it means that you have a Visa Bureau the second one you have again.
if you have any elements in the portal in the binomial, how many routes can you have in the  in the route  how many elements can you have in the route list?
